# CSC-164-Final-Project
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game I created using JavaFX and Java.
The version for JavaFx is 18 and may cause issues displaying
the Tic Tac Toe board correctly, depending on the version of
JavaFX you have.

# Running The Program:
To run the program simply open it in Intelli-J 
IDE and run main in the TicTacToeApplication.java file
