# CSC-164-Final-Project
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game I created using JavaFX and Java.
I am currently working to improve the code as a side project,
so this is an ongoing project

# Running The Program:
To run the program simply open it in Intelli-J 
IDE and run main in the TicTacToeApplication.java file

# Notes to Self:
Would make sense to change PlayerOne class to X
and PlayerTwo class to O (which extends X class)
and also have Computer class that extends X class.

This would make more sense and allow players to 
choose whether they play as X or O and who goes 
first.

Maybe have player as a class and computer as a class
however, player can have a generic for the classes X 
and O.
